      <p class="learnmoreepcparagraph privacyparagraph">Our goal is to help people gain greater control over their health, while partnering with the products and services that support their ongoing health journey. Our software allows you to monitor your health, build and grow your health organizations, and facilitate the research you need to further the understanding of health. As we build this software, privacy is our ABSOLUTE HIGHEST priority. We want to do everything we can to make sure that whatever umbrella your health decisions fall under, that you can do so with the confidence of a configurable, yet secure privacy infrastructure. This is our promise:</p>
      <ol class="list">
        <li>We will only collect data that is useful to improving Seek products, services and your experience.</li>
        <li>We will be transparent about our data practices and will explain them in clear language.</li>
        <li>We will never sell your data, and will only share personally identifiable data when you direct us to (or under the circumstances outlined in our Privacy Policy).</li>
        <li>We will always take the security of your data seriously.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="learnmoreepcparagraph privacyparagraph">To learn more about the data we collect, how that data is used, and the ways it can be shared both by us and by you, please read our Privacy Policy below. Or, if you have any questions, contact us.</p>
      <h1 class="connectheading supportheading termsprivacyheading">Seek Privacy Policy</h1>
      <h2 class="connectheading supportheading termsprivacyheading termsprivacyheading2">Last update August 16, 2015</h2>
      <p class="learnmoreepcparagraph privacyparagraph">Seek designs software that tracks everyday health and fitness, manages hospital and care provider processes, and facilitates multiple points of medical connectivity to evolve the connection between humans and health. This Privacy Policy applies to our software platform (“Platform”), our websites located at <a target="_blank" href="http://seek-health.us/">seek-health.us</a>, community.seek.com (individually a “Site” and collectively “Sites”), Seek’s software (“Software”) and Seek mobile applications (each an “App” and collectively the “Apps”). The Platform, Sites, Software and Apps are collectively referred to in this Policy as the “Seek Service,” and by proceeding to use the Seek Service you consent that we may process the data that we collect from you in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
      <p class="learnmoreepcparagraph privacyparagraph">Because we’re always looking for new and innovative ways to help you achieve your health evolution, this policy may change over time, but any future changes will not affect data that was collected under a previous version of this policy. If any modifications substantially change your rights, we will send an email summarizing the changes to the address associated with your Seek account and provide notice on the Site.</p>
      <p class="learnmoreepcparagraph privacyparagraph">And remember, we’re here to help. If something in this policy does not make sense or if you have any questions, please contact us.</p>
      <h3 class="termsprivacyheading2 supportheading connectheading termsprivacyheading">What Data Does Seek Collect?</h3>
      <h3 class="termsprivacyheading2 supportheading connectheading termsprivacyheading termsprivacyheading3">When You Create a Seek Account</h3>
      <p class="learnmoreepcparagraph privacyparagraph">If you want to access data collected by your Device, Application, or Medical Service, you must create a Seek account. When you create a Seek account, we ask for some personal information, including your email address and date of birth. Your email address will be your Seek account user name, which you will use to log-into your account. We do not display your email address to other users. Instead, others will see the name or nickname you enter in your profile settings.</p>
      <p class="learnmoreepcparagraph privacyparagraph">You can also create your Seek account using a different credential such as a Facebook or Google+ account. We will ask permission to access basic information from that account, such as your name, profile picture, and friend list. You can stop sharing that information with us at any time by removing Seek’s access to that account. We will access your phone’s contact list for the purpose of letting you identify contacts who are Seek users. We do not store your phone’s contact list, and it is deleted immediately after it is used for this purpose.</p>
      <h3 class="termsprivacyheading2 supportheading connectheading termsprivacyheading termsprivacyheading3">When You Add Information to Your Account</h3>
      <p class="learnmoreepcparagraph privacyparagraph">You can customize your Seek experience by adding other types of information to your account, such as entering a food log or setting an alarm, personalizing your profile with photos, participating in discussion boards, or sending messages to your Seek friends. Whenever you add this type of data, we collect it and store it in your Seek account.</p>
      <h3 class="termsprivacyheading2 supportheading connectheading termsprivacyheading termsprivacyheading3">When You Visit Our Sites</h3>
      <p class="learnmoreepcparagraph privacyparagraph">Seek collects industry standard data from everyone who visits our Sites—even if you don’t have a Seek account. This includes log data that automatically records information about your visit, such as your browser type, operating system, the URL of the page that referred you, the different actions you performed, and the IP address you used to access pages on the Site. We use this type of information to provide you with an experience that’s relevant to your location based on the IP address, to prevent Site misuse, and to ensure the Site is working properly. We also collect data from cookies. To see the full list cookies we use and how we use them, please read our <a href="http://www.fitbit.com/privacy#CookiePolicy" target="_blank">Cookie Policy</a>.</p>
      <h3 class="termsprivacyheading2 supportheading connectheading termsprivacyheading termsprivacyheading3">When You Sync Your Device</h3>
      <p class="learnmoreepcparagraph privacyparagraph">When you sync your Device through an App or the Software, data recorded on your Device about your activity is transferred from your Device to our servers. This data is stored and used to provide the Seek Service and is associated with your account. Each time a sync occurs, we log data about the transmission. Some examples of the log data are the sync time and date, device battery level, and the IP address used when syncing.</p>
      <h3 class="termsprivacyheading2 supportheading connectheading termsprivacyheading termsprivacyheading3">When You Make Purchases From Our Store</h3>
      <p class="learnmoreepcparagraph privacyparagraph">We do not view or store your credit card information. This is handled by our third-party payment processor. We store your shipping address so we can process your order through our fulfillment partner. If you are logged into your Seek account when you purchase something on our Site, we associate that order with your Seek account.</p>
      <h3 class="termsprivacyheading2 supportheading connectheading termsprivacyheading termsprivacyheading3">When You Contact Us For Help</h3>
      <p class="learnmoreepcparagraph privacyparagraph">Whenever you contact Seek for help, we collect your name and email address along with additional information you provide in your request so that we can provide you with assistance and improve the Seek Service. If you contact us when you are already logged in to your account, the web form automatically pre-fills this information, so you don’t have to type it manually. You can also contact Seek on public forums such as Twitter or Facebook; however, we cannot maintain the privacy of your communication to us if you contact us through these channels.</p>
      <h3 class="termsprivacyheading2 supportheading connectheading termsprivacyheading termsprivacyheading3">When You Add Friends</h3>
      <p class="learnmoreepcparagraph privacyparagraph">To help you stay motivated on your health journey, Seek lets you add friends who are already Seek users or invite friends who have not yet joined. You can add friends in several ways, such as by providing their email addresses, or by accessing social networking accounts or from the contact list on your phone. When you share your friends’ contact information with us to add them as a friend, we will only use it for this purpose. We do not store your phone’s contact list, and it is deleted immediately after it is used for this purpose.</p>
      <h3 class="termsprivacyheading2 supportheading connectheading termsprivacyheading termsprivacyheading3">When You Activate Location Features</h3>
      <p class="learnmoreepcparagraph privacyparagraph">The Seek Service includes features that require the collection of specific location data, including: GPS signals, device sensors, Wi-Fi access points, and cell tower IDs. We only collect this type of data when you activate a location feature, such as run mapping. We stop collecting this type of data when you deactivate the feature. We store this information in your Seek account. If you are using a mapping feature, we will send your location information to our mapping service provider so they can display your location on a map. They are contractually prevented from sharing or using this data for any other purpose.</p>
      <h3 class="termsprivacyheading2 supportheading connectheading termsprivacyheading termsprivacyheading3">Information From Other Sources</h3>
      <p class="learnmoreepcparagraph privacyparagraph">We do not collect any information about you from other sources outside of your interaction with the Seek Service.</p>

      <ul class="list">
        <li>With companies that are contractually engaged in providing us with services, such as order fulfillment, email management and credit card processing. These companies are obligated by contract to safeguard any PII they receive from us.</li>

If we are going to release your data, we will do our best to provide you with notice in advance by email, unless we are prohibited by law from doing so.</li>
        <li>We may disclose or transfer your PII in connection with the sale, merger, bankruptcy, sale of assets or reorganization of our company.

      <p class="learnmoreepcparagraph privacyparagraph">The Seek Service is hosted and operated entirely in the United States and is subject to United States law. Any personal information that you provide to Seek is being transferred to Seek for use solely in the United States and will be hosted on United States servers. You consent to the transfer of your personal information to the United States. If you are accessing the Seek Service from outside the United States, please be advised that United States law may not offer the same privacy protections as the law of your jurisdiction.</p>
      <p class="learnmoreepcparagraph privacyparagraph">Seek complies with the U.S. - EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S. - Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland.

      <h3 class="termsprivacyheading2 supportheading connectheading termsprivacyheading">COOKIE POLICY</h3>
      <p class="learnmoreepcparagraph privacyparagraph">We use cookies and other technologies like pixel tags and web beacons to improve the functionality of the Seek Service.</p>
      <h3 class="termsprivacyheading2 supportheading connectheading termsprivacyheading termsprivacyheading3">Technologies We Use</h3>
      <p class="learnmoreepcparagraph privacyparagraph">Cookies are text files that are sent by servers to web browsers and stored on your computer. They tell us which parts of the Seek Service you’ve visited so we can figure out which promotions you may like to see or to alert you to software compatibility issues.Web beacons and pixel tags are images embedded in a webpage or email for the purpose of measuring and analyzing usage and activity. Seek, or third party service providers acting on our behalf, may use web beacons and pixel tags to help us analyze usage and improve our functionality.</p>
      <p class="learnmoreepcparagraph privacyparagraph">Web beacons and pixel tags are images embedded in a webpage or email for the purpose of measuring and analyzing usage and activity. Seek, or third party service providers acting on our behalf, may use web beacons and pixel tags to help us analyze usage and improve our functionality.</p>
      <p class="learnmoreepcparagraph privacyparagraph">Social media tools, like widgets and plug-ins, are used so you can share information from Seek on other sites such Facebook and Twitter. These interactive mini-programs collect your IP address, record the pages you visit on our Sites, and set cookies that will enable the widget to function properly. Your interactions with these widgets are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing them, not by Seek’s Privacy Policy. We also use the Facebook and Twitter pixel tags to help us understand how effective our marketing is on those sites.</p>
      <h3 class="termsprivacyheading2 supportheading connectheading termsprivacyheading termsprivacyheading3">Does Seek Honor “Do Not Track” Signals?</h3>
      <p class="learnmoreepcparagraph privacyparagraph">Although we would like to honor the browsers set with a “Do Not Track” signal, the Sites do not currently respond to a DNT or similar signal as it awaits the results of efforts by the policy and legal community to determine the meaning of DNT and the proper way to respond. However, we believe that consumers should exercise choice regarding the collection of this type of data, which is why we disclose the cookies used and provide links to opt-out of those collection practices below.</p>
      <p class="learnmoreepcparagraph privacyparagraph">We use the following third-party data analytics platforms to improve the Seek Service in a variety of ways:</p>
